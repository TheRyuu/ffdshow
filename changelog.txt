Bug fix: Explorer.exe was crashing in Windows Vista.
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1611309&group_id=53761&atid=471489.

Explorer.exe use vfw decoder to get thumbnail.
I disabled CoInitialize & CoUninitialize. These two API functions were
called from different threads, which was the cause of the crashes.

I think the application should have called CoInitialize before here.
Need more testing though.

New version of queue.
As a result, queue becomes effective with Zoom player and MPC + VMR9.

Another fix includes,
 Only queue in VMR7 and overlay mixer.
 In VMR9, try VMR9's internal queue.
 Improved compatibility issue with BSPlayer.
 Windows Media Player is excluded from queueing internally regardless
 of the settings.
 Registry option 'queueCount'.

ListEmptyIMediaSamples is a helper class of queue and does prefetch.
GetBuffer and Receive is now called from the same thread.
If Receive and GetBuffer is called from other threads, GetBuffer often
returns error.
By cooperating with TffOutputQ, ListEmptyIMediaSamples buffers the
IMediaSample as soon as it is released in TffOutputQ::ThreadProc.

(ffmpeg 7352) more simplification

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r704 | Thu Dec 21 17:18:48 2006 UTC | drevil_xxl

(ffmpeg 7333) Don't favor the zero MV if mv0 is used. (PSNR per bitrate
gains ranging from 0 to 0.14, most are <=0.04 though.)

(ffmpeg 7334) Fix special casing of the 0,0 MV for b frames.
(slight PSNR/bitrate gain)

(ffmpeg 7336) Try direct mode MB after QPRD, slight PSNR/bitrate gain if
b frames + QPRD.

(ffmpeg 7341) Don't randomly dissallow direct MBs. Some PSNR/bitrate gain
for b frames with adaptive quant or QPRD.

(ffmpeg 7342) Don't randomly disallow intr4v in adaptive quant.
Some PSNR/bitrate gain if adaptive quant is used.
Initalize qscale_table correctly. (It was pretty much random since the
qp->lambda change.) This probably has not much effect as the table isn't
used currently IIRC.

(ffmpeg 7343) Skip motion estimation and encoding of non direct-0,0 MBs
if the next MB is skiped. (MPEG4 doesn't allow such MBs and in the past
we did ME and encoding until at the end we droped them, so this should
be faster though i didn't benchmark it, benchmark welcome.)

(ffmpeg 7344) I think this if() is useless let's abuse our users to
test this. ;)

(ffmpeg 7345) simplify

(ffmpeg 7346) Use qscale_table in adaptive quant. Some PSNR/bitrate
improvement for adaptive quant.

(ffmpeg 7347) simplify

(ffmpeg 7348) FIXME has already been fixed ages ago.

motion estimation score cache size.

(ffmpeg 6221) Cleanup, from Emanuele Giaquinta <exg@gentoo.org>.

(ffmpeg 7316) vqmin/vqmax --> qmin/qmax in the option description.

(ffmpeg 7318) Bug fix for crashes when SSE is used on unaligned arrays.
No measureable change in speed. This gave random crashes on Win32 and
BeOS. The cause for this bug is that GCC doesn't align the stackframe.
Linux and glibc always ensure this to be true thus this never affected
Linux.

(ffmpeg 7319) av_log(NULL,... -> av_log(avctx,.. where appropriate.

(ffmpeg 6958) mp3 header (de)compression bitstream filter
This will make mp3 frames 4 bytes smaller, it will not give you binary
identical mp3 files, but it will give you mp3 files which decode to
binary identical output.
This will only work in containers providing at least packet size,
sample_rate and number of channels.
Bugreports about mp3 files for which this fails are welcome.
This is experimental (Don't expect compatibility and don't even expect
to be able to decompress what you compressed, hell don't even expect
this to work without editing the source a little.)

to think that it might be best to write the whole function in asm,

Bug fix of rev351

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r396 | Mon Oct 16 10:11:43 2006 UTC | clsid2

(ffmpeg 6702) Shift CABACContext.range right, this reduces the number of
shifts needed in get_cabac() and is slightly faster on P3.
(And should be much faster on P4 as the P4 except the more recent
variants lacks an integer shifter and so shifts have ~10 times longer
latency then simple operations like adds.)

(ffmpeg 6703) This code will not work with PIC as it needs 7 registers
and GCC doesn't support that in PIC.

(ffmpeg 6704) 10l

Patched Media Player Classic + newest ffdshow can use queue without

With non patched Media Player Classic, ffdshow does not use queue in
the setting above.

Bug fix (incomplete): ffdshow crashes in WMEncoder
http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=114617

If ffdshow audio decoder is enabled, WME always crashes. I tried to
debug and found the crash was deep in WME. I though it should be hard
to fix. So I disabled ffdshow audio decoder in WME.

ToDo: Show message to users that ffdshow can't join the graph.

Updated Inno Setup script:
Simplified runtime installation. MSVC80 runtime is now installed into
the ffdshow directory as a private assembly.
There are 4 small components (vfw/acm/avisynth and vdb plugins) that are
(potentially) placed outside the ffdshow directory. For these components
binaries compiled with MSVC71 will be used. This to avoid the need to
install the MSVC80 runtime as a shared assembly or into locations
outside the ffdshow directory (which in theory could lead to version
conflicts).
These binaries are included in SVN, so having the MSVC71
compiler is not required. The source code for these 4 components is
almost never changed. In the event that the code is updated, I will
update the binaries. All runtimes together are just 450KB
(when compressed).

msvcr80.dll and msvcr71.dll installer.

If vcredist_x86 is not packed or the installation of vcredist_x86
failed, and if MSVCR8 is defined, the installer trys to install
msvcr80.dll as private assembly.

Installation of private assembly has version check, reference count
controls, etc.
The version of VC80.CRT is checked before executing vcredist_x86.exe.

MSVCR8 is defined by default.
Please read the header of ffdshow.nsi carefully.

Multithread patch by haruhiko_yamagata 060730:

'Quality control:
 (1) Which do you give preference to image quality or frame rate?
 (2) Which do you choose droping frame or to losing synchronization of
     audio and video?

 As for (1), it is supported only in H.264. By default, it is set to
 skip loop filter/deblocking on delay > 350ms. When the video catches
 up audio, the quality is back. Though the quality drops, I think it's
 better than no new frame for seconds.

 As for (2), on delay > 1500ms, ffdshow give up decoding for a while.
 If the file is H.264, you may have no new frame for seconds.

 Both (1) and (2) have configuration at 'decoder options/
 quality control' in the dialog.

Resize:
 Update to libswscale rev 19211. It fixed the holizontal line problem.
 It may be slower and if it is matter for you, uncheck 'Resize &
 aspect/Settings/Accurate rounding'.

 An old bug fix: While playing resized HD movie, when one try to enter
 new holizontal size the the application sometimes crashes. I set
 minimum holizontal size 64 instead of 8 to fix this.

Multithread patch by haruhiko_yamagata 060721:

'OSD item 'Video delay':
 ffdshow has IQualityControl since rev2411 (just after the release of
 the ffdshow-20051115.exe). When the video is delayed more than 1500ms,
 ffdshow drops a frame. It improves audio-video sync. H.264 (and
 perhaps some other codecs) cannot (?) show the next frame until it
 gets 'sync point'. Next sync point may be very far, so sometimes
 ffdshow cannot show a new frame for seconds.

Resize setting - automatic vertical size setting:
 Improved (?) 'non-square pixel' support (bug fix).
 As for MPC + MKV, use proper external mkv spliter and disable MPC
 internal matroska source filter for non-square pixel support.

Avoid multithreading of resize (SwScaler) if the CPU is Pentium4-HT,
it is not faster at all and use more CPU. (SwScaler depends much on
MMX and P4HT have only one MMX unit.)

Use more multithreading of resize (SwScaler) if the CPU is dual core
or multi-CPU.

Imported changes of SwScaler from mplayer/libswscale.
 Rewrited multithreading of SwScaler to synronize to mplayer/libswscale
 (doesn't mean it fixes the holizontal line problem).

Multithread patch by haruhiko_yamagata 060709:

'Resize setting - automatic vertical size setting
 Specify horizontal size and enter 0 as vertical size for Auto.
 I don't think the user interface is a good idea. What should it be
 like? I'm trying to support the 'non-square pixcel', but it depends on
 video renderer's behavior.

Bug fix:
 Window media player hangs up when its picture tuning is on and
 'Queue output samples' is on. Besides it is not effective to queue in
 WMP (because WMP doesn't give buffer soon and ffdshow have to wait).
 So, 'Queue output samples' is off by default. It is reserved in dialog
 expecting improvement by Microsoft in the future.

Hang up on ZoomPlayer on initialize:
 TffdshowDecVideo::IsOldRenderer.

Hang up on Resize or aspect settings change:
 TffdshowDecVideo::reconnectOutput

Theoretical bug fix(?) of SwScaler-multithreading:
 Because the code seems not to be used in ffdshow, it is not tested.

For better single CPU/multithreading:
 THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL for video renderer.
 THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL, tested on prior patch, was not good
 on WMP.

Fixed user defined OSD, broken since last patch.

Refuse loading from blacklist:
 Re-installing ffdshow.ax sometimes fails because ffdshow.ax cannot be

 annoying error on re-install that one have to log off.
 With this patch, ffdshow.ax avoids to be loaded by returning false on

Multithread patch by haruhiko_yamagata 060604:

'For better single CPU/multithreading (test). In some cases, output
 queue lost performance. The streaming thread has access to the VRAM
 buffer, the video renderer thread has it too. Nervus VRAM should not
 be accessed from two threads simultaneously.

 This time, THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL for video rendering thread.
 This will prevent simultaneous access to VRAM from two threads. This
 may cause conflict with audio rendering thread. The side effect would
 be clicking noise in the audio. It was not heard in my limited tests.
 If it apears, I have another option to test.
 Please report.

To 2546 bug fix SwScaler

Bug fix: Crash on default setting of Zoom Player, old renderer of
MPC, etc.

Certain video renderer cannot run on child thread. It includes the
default renderer of Windows 2000 or older, the default of Zoom Player
(Overlay Mixer, Standard Renderer), 'Old Renderer' of MPC, etc. In this
case, multithreading around video renderer is avoided and Resize is
processed on multithread.

I upload this patch for testing. Please test this. It might be buggy.
Any advice is wellcome. This patch can be applied to Rev 2507. Go to
trunk directory.

1. About multithreading of ffdshow video playback

The objective of multithreading is to reduce frame drops. This patch
reduce frame drops by decording and resizing next frame while video
renderer is working on other thread. Resize is processed on multithread
when the video renderer is faster than the decoder. For example
upscaling DVD to HDTV with ffdshow and VMR9 renderless mode of media
player classic give very good quality. But it requires very high CPU
power and even current powerfull CPU may drop frames without
multithreading. This patch is optimized for such case.
